# Blocks-Turret

block.fire-js.name = Smasher
block.fire-js.description = Shoots clusters of shells at ground enemy targets over long distances.
block.fire-js.info = Initially researched at Landing Base, used for frontline defense by the enemy.\n\nAs a large early artillery, it is small, inexpensive, and easy to use. As a projectile launcher with a wide range of detections, it is loaded with metaglass shells, which is enough to shatter most low-tier units beyond the enemy's range.\n\nThe only drawback is that it can only have anti-aircraft capabilities after loading with sulflame alloy shells, and it requires manual targeting. But who still uses it by then...

block.fire-yg.name = Nightmare
block.fire-yg.description = Fires overpowered pierce beams at enemy targets rapidly.
block.fire-yg.info = Initially researched at Landing Base, used for frontline defense by the enemy.\n\nIt was researched along with the Smasher, but unlike the former, its ingenious structure allows it to almost melt various types of ammunition. As a high-damage laser emitter, its presence can be seen almost everywhere - from being the main defense to a supporting role in top-level defenses, it handles low-tier units with ease and can overpower high-tier units with numerical advantage.\n\n[teal]Enemies melted by its laser, on the brink of death, finally see that terrifying and eerie light.

block.fire-fulmination.name = Fulmination
block.fire-fulmination.description = Fires branched arcs of electricity at ground targets.

block.fire-dr.name = Ignition
block.fire-dr.description = Fires a continuous slow-moving single-target laser at enemy targets.

block.fire-blossom.name = Blossom
block.fire-blossom.description = Fires two seeking cluster-missiles at enemy targets.
block.fire-blossom.info = Initially researched at Beach Landing.\n\nAs a turret that can be deployed using only electricity and is relatively small, it has been very popular since its development. It is suitable for dealing with low-tier units, but with numerical superiority and various attack speed bonuses, it also has the ability to take on some high-tier units. However, due to its low-damage and multi-stage attack pattern, it always seems weak and ineffective.\n\nAs a cluster missile launcher, the appearance of its missiles always reminds people of a certain naval unit. And indeed, its designer was once a member of the navy in the first army of the Fire Company. The agile and wide-ranging scouting abilities of the supporting naval units, Cyerce, were highly favored by them... and also caused them hardships of course.

block.fire-gambler.name = Gambler
block.fire-gambler.description = Fires a barrage of shrapnels at enemy targets.\nHas a chance to fire a better bullet type depending on the level of ammo being used, until the highest level.\n\n"It resonates with otherworldly energy."
block.fire-gambler.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop.\nTexts below are about one of its stories.\n\n\
...[#00FFFF]It's not over yet![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The four computer screens simultaneously displayed this line of text, and they all knew exactly what to do at this moment.\n\
"Dultrus, ADRENALINE! "Before the sentence was finished, Dultrus had already loaded "The Sevens Striker", with his adrenaline mode activated.\n\
\n\
[#FFD700]Jackpot!!![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The words appeared above Dultrus' character, meanwhile "The Sevens Striker" immediately unleashed a barrage of bullets, coupled with the high damage boost from the adrenaline, constantly inflicting heavy damage on the worm covered in scales in front of them. With the additional support damage from the other three players, the worm's health bar quickly plummeted.\n\
\n\
[#00FFFF]A GOD DOES NOT FEAR DEATH![lightgray]\n\
\n\
Accompanying this message was the scene of the worm's body slowly coming to a stop, with his scales gradually falling apart...\n\
\n\
[#00FFFF]The frigid moon shimmers brightly.[lightgray]\n\
[#FFA500]The harvest moon glows eerily.[lightgray]\n\
[#FFA500]The dark sun awaits.[lightgray]\n\
[#AF4BFF]The devourer of Gods has been defeated![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The four of them cheered at the same time. One of them then suggested, "Let's call it a day for today, we should get back to work."\n\
"Uh, that weapon, called "The Sevens Striker", is pretty cool, and could be developed into a turret." Dultrus said.\n\
"You're really out of your mind, this is real life. Research on the random shell launcher still hasn't made any progress, and if we ignore that and turn it into a normal turret, what's the difference from other shotguns?" another person said.\n\
"Don't question it, I have my ways." Dultrus seemed confident.\n\
\n\
Months later, when Dultrus presented his prototype at a conference, almost everyone was shocked - "Gambler", a shotgun that crushes ammunition into shrapnel. Using its unique structure, while the shrapnel is fired, a part of it also sticks to the barrel. Over time, every time ammunition is fired, the previously left shrapnel attached to the barrel will also be ejected, achieving a "RANDOM" effect.\n\
\n\
After the presentation, voices of discussion, ridicule, questioning, and insults appeared increasingly louder in the conference hall. Such a structural design was a blatant challenge to the attendees and the "Fire Company the Second Army Convention" - leaving aside whether the kinetic energy produced by the ammunition being fired can remove the attached shrapnel, crushing the ammunition in the barrel is extremely dangerous. Used for a long time without exploding, it would be extraordinary.\n\
\n\
This situation lasted for more than a minute, and finally Dultrus declared that he had conducted multiple rounds of safety tests and there were no safety hazards. However, after a comprehensive evaluation, the qualified examiners judged it to be a "product with moderate safety risk" and denied the request for large-scale deployment, additionally cancelling Dultrus' three-month product development rights.\n\
\n\
As the examiners left, one of them quietly said to Dultrus, "Sorry bro, it's not you didn't give enough, but it's I'm afraid that one day if I'm assigned to the battlefield, I might die because of this thing... I did my best to judge it to be "moderate"... take care of yourself."\n\
\n\
As a consequence, Dultrus naturally felt frustrated. Afterward he became addicted to the gacha game, but due to decision-making difficulties, he couldn't decide which one to play first. So he invited the three friends who had played Calamity with him initially to use "Gambler" to make a decision.\n\
"...I'm only left with the hardened alloy, so I choose..." the last person made the decision. When his words came out, other three people looked at him slightly surprised.\n\
"Fine, let's just go with this..." Dultrus set up the target on a training wall in the distance. With seven consecutive rounds from the "Gambler", they all knew the final outcome of this lucky roulette.

block.fire-dh.name = Seaquake
block.fire-dh.description = Fires overpowered streams of liquid at enemy targets. Automatically extinguishes fires when supplied with water. Requires power.
block.fire-dh.info = Initially researched at Scorching Volcano.\n\nAs a powerful liquid turret developed by the Fire Company, it is widely used internally as an automatic fire extinguisher with outstanding fire prevention effects.\n\nThe following is an interview record:\n\n\
Reporter: Next, I will conduct a series of interviews with you about the "Seaquake", please be prepared.\n\
Eshville: Okay, please blur my name, thank you, since my next remarks may have some negative impact on the "Seaquake".\n\
Reporter: Okay, Mr. Eshville.\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: It was a sunny... um... noon at the time, I was walking alone in a corridor of the company, where there was no one else around...\n\
(The onlookers couldn't help but hold their breath)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: Then I took out a pack of cigarettes, ready to enjoy a pleasant lunch break, and defy the company's no-smoking regulations.\n\
(The onlookers disappointedly booed)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: Just as I was about to light the cigarette, a stream of water suddenly sprayed towards my lighter!!\n\
Reporter: So, this incident is... (interrupted)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: The water stream from the f***ing "Seaquake" directly washed away my cigarette and lighter!!! A mixture of tobacco and glass shards spread on the floor in front of me, leaving me stunned there...\n\
Reporter: So you learnt from it... (interrupted again)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: I will NEVER buy a regular glass lighter from this brand again!!\n\
Reporter: Okay, now we are proud to introduce the new glass lighter from (blocked due to insufficient advertising fees) company...

block.fire-ql.name = Distance
block.fire-ql.description = Launches a powerful missile at ground enemy targets over vast distances.
block.fire-ql.info = Initially researched at Eteriver Stronghold, used as a part of the enemy's forward defense system.\n\nAs one of the rare missile launchers, it has an extremely long detection range and high damage that no other turret in the 3*3-sized series can match, making it effective for both defense and attack.\nHowever, its disadvantage lies in its heavy reliance on cooldowns and overdrive bonuses, as well as its high ammunition consumption.

block.fire-magnetic-domain.name = Magnetic Domain
block.fire-magnetic-domain.description = Generates energy magnetic field, releasing directional energy beams to strike all enemy units and structures nearby and electrify enemy units.

block.fire-grudge.name = Grudge
block.fire-grudge.description = Fires huge bullets at enemy targets. Highly effective to well-armored units.\n[red]Can't be overdriven for safety reasons.
block.fire-grudge.details = [white]Target! [yellow]Fire! [orange]Rend! [scarlet]Pulverize!
block.fire-grudge.info = Initially researched at Desolate Fortification, deserted in the middle of the area.\nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "Spectre".\n\nThe representative work of the old school - as the superior of the "Spectre", it has all the characteristics of the former: heavy, clumsy but appreciably lethal. Its design compatibility allows it to still use thorium as ammunition, without worrying about saving ammunition expenses, surpassing the modernization faction - "Swarmer" and "Cyclone", which only use surge alloy ammunition. For wealthier situations, it still provides a better choice, using detonation mixture or even hardened alloy.\n\nUnder the coolant supply, the performance of advanced ammunition is excellent, able to easily shred solitary enemy units. Sufficient "Grudge" even makes the "Apollo" fleet turn back.\nHowever, despite its high upper limit, its barrel heating issue has not been properly resolved, leading to its performance without coolant being even worse than some 2*2-sized turrets.\n\nObjectively speaking, "Grudge" is still one of the most cost-effective turrets. To this day it's still widely used in Fire Company, and it has set the record of destructing 10 "Reign" mechs when supplied with hardened alloy and cryofluid, which is the best proof.

block.fire-aerolite.name = Aerolite
block.fire-aerolite.description = High energy explosive thrower, causing devastating damage to enemy facilities over vast distances.
block.fire-aerolite.details = One of the cutting-edge products developed by Fire Company. Its core adopts a novel structural design never previously used within Fire Company, granting it a range far exceeding conventional non-missile turrets. The exceptionally long attack range allows it to rival even "Distance" turret.\nFire Company's engineers made repeated modifications in attempts to enable it to counter aerial units to some extent. While the results fell short of expectations, its overwhelming area-denial capabilities have led to widespread deployment in ground battlefields.\n[scarlet]Firepower coverage, kid!
block.fire-aerolite.info = Initially discovered at Beach Landing, yet its internal structure was not deciphered until the occupation of Desolate Fortification and the research of Grudge.\nThe following is a dialogue between Fire Company's First Councillor and Second Councillor on the afternoon of Aerolite's initial research:\n\n\
/* ================ */\n\
Private Go Room Access Log\n\n\
Date: Year 1293 of the Inuit Calendar, August 19\n\
\n\
"Tengen..." The elder known as the Second Councillor stared at the black stone at the board's center, shaking his head in silence.\n\
The young man opposite, hearing no response, gestured for the elder to proceed.\n\
After a hesitant pause, the elder placed his stone.\n\
The youth, representing the radical faction, countered swiftly.\n\
The conservative elder fell into deep contemplation, eyes locked on the grid.\n\
"Has Fire Company’s legendary slacking-off Go master truly been bested by a junior?" teased the First Councillor.\n\
The elder remained silent, slowly rotating two white stones in his palm.\n\
Three minutes later, the elder placed another stone.\n\
The youth retaliated immediately.\n\
The elder froze as three black stones aligned diagonally.\n\
"Fascinating. Challenging me to "Gomoku" in a Go room..." The elder dropped his stone with a wry smile.\n\
The youth leaned back, gazing through the reinforced glass at the monolithic gray buildings labeled "Strategic Support Division - R&D Department". The setting sun, piercing the thin ozone-depleted atmosphere, gilded his First Councillor badge. The elder’s eyes flickered with tension, yet he held his tongue.\n\
Stones fell in succession.\n\
After a dozen moves, the elder slumped into his chair, exhaling. "Checkmate."\n\
The youth chuckled. "Impossible."\n\
"Against absolute mastery, even underhanded tactics fail. Wouldn’t you agree?" The elder’s words carried double meaning—both for the game and the yet-unfledged ambush planned by the Chief Councillor against the Inuit 1st Army’s Light Armor Raiders.\n\
The youth scooped a handful of black stones, scattering them across the board. Five aligned perfectly. "Victory."\n\
"You’ve outgrown such childish antics," sighed the elder.\n\
"You’re mistaken."\n\
Silence lingered. Bored, the youth muttered, "What if... an energy beyond convention intervened?"\n\
"Elaborate."\n\
"See that fortress?" The youth pointed. "Feel the tremors?"\n\
The elder frowned.\n\
"The roar of a meteor strike..." The youth looked beyond the skyline.\n\
Impatience tightened the elder’s face.\n\
With a disappointed sigh, the youth tapped the solid cylindrical table. Its surface flipped, glowing faintly. "You truly know nothing of R&D’s project..."\n\
A few taps later, the elder stared at the morning’s data logs.\n\
"'Aerolite'..." The elder whispered. His white stone clattered to the floor, splitting in two. The floor yawned, devouring the fragments, only for a pristine replacement to materialize in the stone box.\n\
\n\
/* ================ */\n\
\n\
August 21, Year 1293 of the Inuit Calendar - Sector 139 "Frozen Crag", The Inuit 1st Army’s 22nd Light Armor Raider Division was obliterated under catastrophic artillery bombardment. Witnesses reported all ice in the sector sublimating instantly from blast heat, while the acrid stench of detonation compound lingered for three days. 

block.fire-magnetic-sphere.name = Magnetic Sphere
block.fire-magnetic-sphere.description = Fires a charged, decelerated sphere at aerial enemy targets.\n\The sphere will detect whether there's a target nearby and release directional lightning attacking target.\nThe sphere will select and chase a target nearby if it comes to the end.\n\n"It resonates with otherworldly energy."
block.fire-magnetic-sphere.info = First researched at Frostbite Peak, deployed at enemy fortifications.\n\
As one of the electromagnetic tech research outcomes, it has remarkable anti-air capability---its signature electromagnetic energy sphere has become a nightmare for air forces, with a seventy-five-block detection range that even allows it to contend with the Scorch Sun. The energy sphere also has tracking capability, and few units can escape once locked on; most end up being cleaved in two.\n\
Its simple deployment is another major advantage---it only requires power. The cooling provided by adjacent cooling facilities can enhance its attack speed by cooling the barrel, but it doesn't support overspeed projection bonuses to avoid the marginal effects of such enhancements.

block.fire-scab.name = Scab
block.fire-scab.description = Fires homing flesh bullets at enemy targets.
block.fire-scab.info = Initially researched at Stormy Coast, deployed as defensive facility within enemy research stations.\n\nTo date, this remains one of our few studies on [#B32E1B]Flesh Tech[], yet a critical breakthrough. Preliminary analysis has confirmed beyond doubt that "the flesh mass possesses self-awareness" - a fact now indisputable.\n\nThe turret uses flesh as ammunition material. Remarkably, the projectiles exhibit faint enemy-tracking capabilities, actively homing toward signal sources - a feature that normally requires high-grade semiconductor materials like [#814E25]Logic Alloy[].\nThe true horror unfolds upon impact. Due to the processed material’s elasticity, high-concentration flesh projectiles can reconfigure their form under kinetic force, adhering to targets to inflict sustained damage until expelled by the host’s immune response. However, if the target carries even a trace of moisture, the flesh activates - draining all water to fuel its proliferation, overwhelming the host’s defenses, and ultimately consuming it entirely.\n\n"Our only recourse was to retrofit all post-ban production units with new chips, mandating they remain thoroughly dry during combat." Vakylis, First Director of Fire Company’s Flesh Architecture Division.

block.fire-obstruction.name = Obstruction
block.fire-obstruction.description = Fires energetic balls, destroying nearby bullets and damaging gathered units.\n\n"It resonates with otherworldly energy."

block.fire-magnetic-rail.name = [WiP]Magnetic Rail

block.fire-sqlnq.description = Collects a large amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, and condenses it into water. Require large amounts of power.

block.fire-swzzsj.name = Biomass Cultivator
block.fire-swzzsj.description = Collects tiny concentrations of atmospheric spores, and cultivates them into spore pods with advanced technology. More efficient than cultivator.
block.fire-swzzsj.info = Initially researched at Spore Fiord, located at the site of power generators.\nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "Cultivator".\n\n[lightgray]The fate of this planet being contaminated by these organisms was already destined...\nThe indigenous people of Planet Lysetta had indeed put effort into developing such technology, indicating that they had worked hard and made attempts to control the spread of spores. However, these intelligent, dangerous organisms are inherently uncontrollable, and we no longer find the later [#B32E1B]"Tragic Result"[] surprising.

block.fire-lbzt.name = Fission Drill
block.fire-lbzt.description = Uses a large amount of thorium to lead to fissions, leading ores escape from its position. (I'm kidding)

block.fire-stacked-cultivator.name = Stacked Cultivator

block.fire-constraint-extractor.name = Constraint Extractor
block.fire-constraint-extractor.description = Focuses a beam for long-distance mineral mining. Requires power.\nDue to the large amount of heat generated while working, mining can only be carried out at a lower speed.\nNeeds to configure desired mineral manually, and the extractor will automatically search for and mine the nearest target.\nOptionally uses cryofluid to boost efficiency.

block.fire-focusing-extractor.name = Focusing Extractor
block.fire-focusing-extractor.description = Focuses a beam for long-distance mineral mining. Requires an amount of power.\nEquipped with more focusing devices and improved heat dissipation structure, allowing for further increase in extraction speed.\nOptionally uses liquid nitrogen to boost efficiency.



# Blocks-Distribution

composite.info = \nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "{0}".\n\nAs the superior of "{0}", it can perfectly adapt to the former, once again proving the claim that "Lysetta Tech originates from Serpulo" without words.\n\nOnce the composite distribution components family was developed, it was immediately put into large-scale use, receiving countless praises - more cost-effective, better to use, more durable, and more powerful than their inferior.\n\nHowever, their inferior have not been eliminated: units without intermediate and above construction permits are not allowed to use composite distribution components, so they still serve as teaching tools for beginners. In addition, small integrated facilities also try to avoid using composite distribution components to avoid excessive costs...

block.fire-fhcsd.name = Composite Conveyor
block.fire-fhcsd.description = Transports items forward.\nFaster than a titanium conveyor.
block.fire-fhcsd.info = Initially researched at Frozen Ground, discovered abandoned production facilities near the river channel.

block.fire-hardened-alloy-conveyor.name = Hardened Alloy Conveyor
block.fire-hardened-alloy-conveyor.description = Transports items forward in batches. Accepts items at the back, and unloads them in three directions at the front. Requires multiple loading and unloading points for peak throughput.\nFaster than a plastanium conveyor.

block.fire-composite-bridge-conveyor.description = Instantly transports items over terrain or buildings.\nLonger range than the item bridge.
block.fire-composite-bridge-conveyor.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.

block.fire-composite-router.name = Composite Router
block.fire-composite-router.description = [sky]Instantly[] distributes input items to 3 output directions, however [scarlet]max consecution is limited[].\nDistributes randomly in singleplayer games, however in order to avoid synchronization issues, equal distribution is used instead in multiplayer games.\n\nSupport linkage operations with [accent]Logic Processor[]. When controlled by the instruction "Control-config", allows directional distribution with specific values:\n[white]0 -> Right 1 -> Up\n2 -> Left 3 -> Down
block.fire-composite-router.details = router router router router router router
block.fire-composite-router.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.



# Blocks-Liquid

block.fire-magnetic-ring-pump.name = Magnetic Ring Pump
block.fire-magnetic-ring-pump.description = Pumps and outputs liquids in a much greater efficiency. Requires power.

block.fire-composite-liquid-router.name = Composite Liquid Router
block.fire-composite-liquid-router.description = Accepts liquids from one direction and outputs them to up to 3 other directions equally. Can also store a sizeable amount of liquid.
block.fire-composite-liquid-router.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.

block.fire-composite-bridge-conduit.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.



# Blocks-Power

block.fire-zjjd.name = Conductor Power Node
block.fire-zjjd.description = A long-range power node with fewer available connections than large power node. Can store an amount of power.

block.fire-yrfdj.name = Flame Generator
block.fire-yrfdj.description = Burns highly-flammable materials to generate power. Requires cryofluid as coolant.
block.fire-yrfdj.info = Initially researched at Chilly Mountains, found abandoned at a water pit site.\n\nThe climate conditions in Chilly Mountains are extremely harsh, and traditional fire-based generators are of no use here. However, it can easily handle power generation tasks - this is because it only burns high-performance fuel and can guarantee normal operation while providing a large amount of power. \nDue to its sincere building materials and ingenious structural design, its use cases are extremely wide-ranging, from large-scale modular use to bulk use. The only drawback is that its energy conversion efficiency seems to be not very high, with a considerable amount of energy being converted into heat and lost. Therefore, compared to its sister - differential generators, it also requires additional coolant expenses.

block.fire-hydroelectric-generator.name = Hydroelectric Generator
block.fire-hydroelectric-generator.description = Utilizes water flow to impact fan blades and generate power. The faster the water flow velocity, the greater the power generation.
block.fire-hydroelectric-generator.details = It is interesting that its power generation actually depends on the variance of the liquid depth below. Why is this value related to the water flow velocity...

block.fire-hydroelectric-generator-large.name = Large Hydroelectric Generator

Previous generations of engineers had all attempted to improve the old silicon furnace, but all ended in failure. Flammable materials were needed to provide the temperature required for refining, otherwise, the quality of the silicon product would not be qualified.\nAfter obtaining its design prototype and finished product, the engineers were all amazed by the wisdom of its developer, and decided unanimously to put it into large-scale application directly. At the same time, there were rumors about the indigenous people of Planet Lysetta controlling alien technology...\nBut look at the exaggerated power usage... an energy crisis might be triggered?

More deadly."
block.fire-hardened-alloy-crucible.info = Initially researched at Desolate Fortification.\n\n...The original codename for the action at Desolate Fortification marsh was "Urgent Support". "Support" actually refers to "supporting to research the Hardened Alloy Crucible". This action was the only way for allied forces to obtain information about the factory...\nThe almost crazy structural design. Input apart from the basic thorium and plastanium, water and excessive electricity are used instead of kindling alloy to heat. Against the backdrop of the dwindling expenditure on the kindling alloy production line, this was the only way out.\n\nFor this, work is not a fun thing - a large amount of power supply causes the factory's electric meter to reverse and also leads to a huge release of heat. Using a large amount of water to assist in heat dissipation is extremely poor... for it, this is just enough. In the high-temperature and high-pressure overloaded environment, the energy surge brought about by production is inevitable. Metal ion-colored lightning may even occasionally be emitted from the smoke exhaust fan, with the color depending on the main components in the smoke at the time.\n\nThe enormous heat released during work makes it ignorant of what winter is, unfortunately few people can use it for warmth - its structure dictates its high instability, and in [teal]rare cases[] may even trigger [scarlet]a disaster[]. The radioactivity of the thorium raw materials adds another layer of deathly veil, and only a few assigned workers can approach it for operation and maintenance.\n\n[lightgray]As for the rare situations mentioned... hope never encounter them.

block.fire-primary-interplanetary-accelerator.details = Journey's Beginning.\n\nAccording to the compulsory education physics knowledge on Serpulo: Consider two objects designated as A and B. When object A is subjected to a force with constant magnitude m*v²/R (where m represents A's mass, v its velocity, and R the distance from A to a fixed point) that always points toward this fixed point, A will perform uniform circular motion around that point. This force acting on A is called centripetal force.\nHowever, when expanding the perspective: If object B exists at the fixed point, with both objects possessing sufficient mass and separation distance, and B being significantly more massive than A, both A and B will experience mutually equal gravitational forces in opposite directions according to the law of universal gravitation. For the less massive object A, this gravitational force can effectively serve as the centripetal force for circular motion, creating the appearance of A orbiting around nearly stationary B.\n\nThis theory was proposed on Serpulo over a millennium ago. Brilliant scientists had already considered applying this principle to celestial bodies, hoping to develop interstellar travel methods for interplanetary deployment and galactic colonization through such research.\nYet formidable theoretical challenges followed: According to the gravitational force formula F=G*M*m/R² (where G is the gravitational constant, M and m the masses, R the separation distance), escape velocity requirements dictate that for an object to overcome gravitational pull, it must satisfy m*v²/R>G*M*m/R², simplifying to v>√(G*M/R).\n\nThrough persistent efforts, scientists successfully measured R, M and G within the subsequent two centuries, ultimately calculating the required velocities. However, constrained by the applied research department's technological limitations, they struggled to determine viable methods for safely accelerating payloads to these critical speeds.\nThe breakthrough came during the campaign at Planetary Launch Terminal, where captured enemy prototype blueprints inspired them to develop an "primary" electromagnetic acceleration system they claimed as "their own".\n\nCuriously, within two minutes of the applied research department announcing successful development, near-Serpulo satellites sequentially detected unidentified signals of varying intensities...

\n\
/* ================ */\n\
\n\
Case: FNP-003\n\
Date: Inuit November 23, 2113\n\
Location: Fire Company, Underground Interrogation Room No.010\n\
\n\
The interrogator leisurely pulls out a cigarette box from his pocket, lit one, and asked: "What was your motive for releasing the Flesh?"\n\
The elder sitting across from the interrogator seemed to be choked by the smoke, coughed twice, and slowly began to speak:\n\
"When I was a child, I wanted to be everything.\n\
"I wanted to be the chief councilor of the Fire Company, I wanted to be the President of the Inuit Federation, I wanted to be the commander of the third army of the Fire Company, I dreamed of rebuilding our beautiful home planet, Chael.\n\
"When older, I aspired to be a soldier, an engineer, creating value for society."\n\
Interrogator interrupted: "Enough. Stop rambling about your school days to stall... As a retiring senior interrogator of the Fire Company, I assure you - no one will risk being bisected by magnetic spheres to rescue a human traitor."\n\
The elder chuckled: "If so, why rush me? Just eager to clock out."\n\
He continued:\n\
"When I went to college on Inuit, I found I had changed.\n\
"I wanted to be a freelance mercenary, a spaceship pilot, and I even considered becoming a wandering poet travelling the mountains and rivers of Inuit.\n\
"Yet ultimately... I became none of these. Just an ordinary technician."\n\
The interrogator couldn't help but interrupt again: "...What's wrong with technicians? I used to be a tech-- ..."\n\
The elder ignored:\n\
"Twenty years without a single day off... Working endless shifts, countless heart palpitations made me fear sudden death... Yet I survived, sustained by hatred for this exploitative company...\n\
"That day, I saw it trapped in a jar...\n\
"We mirrored each other - one confined to oppressive labor, the other tortured in glass...\n\
"Whether out of sympathy or something else, I smashed that jar...\n\
"...And what followed needs no retelling."\n\
Interrogator asked "Did you consider the consequences? Never heard 'Different species, different hearts'?!"\n\
The elder laughed with suppressed madness:\n\
"You treat the lower-level employees worse than f***ing livestock... Every denied leave request made me think - those 'protected animals' eat and sleep freely, while we work until discarded to wander in streets, no one cares until we die from starvation or cold... Where are your vaunted f***ing 'human rights'?!\n\
"Your 'different species' rhetoric is just arrogance masking oppression...\n\
"Know why wolves help crippled packmates? Even slaughtered beasts show solidarity - why do humans slaughter each other?!"\n\
Interrogator narrows his eyes: "'You humans'..."\n\
The elder said fell silent.\n\
Interrogator clapped: "Enough. You've provided nothing useful..."\n\
Suddenly, the elder convulsed.\n\
His limbs swell grotesquely, tumorous growths erupting across his body, rapidly filling half the interrogation room.\n\
The defense system on the wall of the interrogation room activated in time, several "ignition" turrets instantly incinerating the monstrosity to ash.\n\
\n\
/* ================ */\n\

Products utilizing Hardened Alloy are now proliferating.\n\nEvidence suggests its patent belongs not to enemy factions, but to the Lysetta natives, who widely used it as construction material... though they seemingly mistook it for ordinary stone.\nDuring a minor battle against foreign invaders, with their defenses on the verge of collapse, the Lysetta finally recalled their warehouses packed with unused Hardened Alloy...\nAs the warehouse doors burst open, the alloy stored within saw daylight again—its pristine sheen preserved by superior corrosion resistance.\nYet its fate proved less glorious than "being loaded into turrets as ammo". Instead, the Lysetta resorted to hurling it by hand.\nSurprisingly, this proved brutally effective. Anyone struck by it would be in deep trouble...

sector.fire-bzxw.name = Spore Fiord
sector.fire-bzxw.description = After Darksand Peak-forest, this sector was detected. An amount of enemy force has been already stationed here.\nThe detection signs indicate that there was already some kind of force trying to confront the enemy before out arrival, but they failed.\nEradicate enemies, capture the sector and research [accent]advanced material processing technology[] and [accent]primary spore cultivation technology[].\n\nEnemies will begin their attack in a short time, build up defenses as soon as possible.

sector.fire-zrhs.name = Scorching Volcano
sector.fire-zrhs.description = As we went deeper into the North Pole, the volcanic zone in this area was located, which is one of the most violent plates in Lysetta.\n"A pure hell..."This is what flying detector showed on its screen after returning from there.\n\nPay attention to repairing buildings damaged by the earthquake in time, and defend the large number of troops sent by enemy.
sector.fire-lava-stronghold.name = Lava Stronghold
sector.fire-lava-stronghold.description = Having disintegrated the enemy forces in Scorching Volcano, it's time to deal a counter-blow to the North Pole.\nEnemy forces have built a complete defence and coupled the high temperature. Large allied units were unable to be delivered here, making the stronghold hard to capture.\n\nHowever, remember the [accent]blue, light strike ships[white] in Desolate Fortification? They were actually the elite units seized by allied forces in the latest attack here.\nAnyway, flying detector has found the equipment used to summon these strike ships here.\n\nAllied forces have established a base here. Take over the base, leave nothing standing, research their tech.

sector.fire-hhys.name = Eteriver Stronghold
sector.fire-hhys.description = One of many parts of Eteriver. Tt is detected that enemy has used [accent]a kind of new turret[] that we have never seen.\nCapture the area to clear the threats around the Darksand Peak-forest, and research the new turret.\n\nDetection radar indicates that [scarlet]an unknown large unit[] skulks there, build high-tier turrets to defend enemy's sudden attack.
sector.fire-lfsm.name = Chilly Mountains
sector.fire-lfsm.description = The lifeless Mountains. Records show there contains the tech of a [accent]brand-new, efficient generator[].\nFend off enemies, research the generator.\n\n[lightgray]There also contains reinforced enemy forces, don't be fooled by the long spacing between enemy attacks.
sector.fire-stormy-coast.name = Stormy Coast
sector.fire-stormy-coast.description = Following a tributary of the Eteriver, we arrived in this coastal area where the detector indicated a small enemy force stationed nearby.\nAfter a fierce battle, this is now the last remaining stronghold.\n\nHowever, the enemy's reinforcements far exceeded our estimates, with the radar map showing a large enemy force swarming towards the area, including elite force.\nAdditionally, through the images transmitted back by the detector from behind enemy lines, we discovered it appears to be a spore contamination source, where the enemy has established a small flesh research facility.\n\nRegardless, repelling enemy's attack and capture this sector, research th e preliminary tech of [#B32E1B]Flesh[], and gain an advantage for future maritime operations.\n\n[lightgray]The weather may be quite severe, please take necessary preparations.
sector.fire-branched-rivers.name = Branched Rivers
sector.fire-branched-rivers.description = A section of the Eteriver. River there branches into multiple tributaries, providing rapid access to surrounding sectors.\nHowever, the turbulent currents here appear to have swept away most mineral deposits, and the crisscrossing waterways grant enemy naval forces exceptional mobility, making the region strategically vulnerable.\nA covert base along the riverbank had been established. Detectors have scanned [accent]unidentified type of liquid pumps and tanks[] nearby.\nWhile enemy forces are unlikely to arrive imminently, if the base is detected, they could swiftly deploy via the river to besiege us.\n\nSecure the area to research [accent]advanced water extraction, purification, and storage technology[]. Establish a forward operating base for expanded territorial control.
sector.fire-rubble-ridge.name = Rubble Ridge
sector.fire-rubble-ridge.description = Amidst the mountain ranges, we discovered the remnants of a concealed factory complex. Despite the severely depleted mineral resources in this area, the scale of the ruins is unexpectedly vast, raising significant suspicion.\nOur analysis suggests two hypotheses:\n1. The site may have once been resource-rich, but geological shifts buried the mineral veins beneath the mountains. However, the structural coherence of the ruins contradicts this theory, as the materials’ durability would not withstand such cataclysmic changes.\n2. The site likely employed a [accent]brand-new extraction facility[] capable of bypassing conventional mining limitations.\nPreliminary scans strongly support the second hypothesis. Capture this sector and research the extraction facility.\n\nNote that the region’s unique topography is dominated by an [scarlet]anomalous electromagnetic cloud[]. Any attempt to deploy overmass cores (e.g. Core: Nucleus, Core: Bulwark) will trigger immediate detonation when making landing. Reinforcements cannot be dispatched either.
sector.fire-tainted-estuary.name = Tainted Estuary
sector.fire-tainted-estuary.description = Having captured Branched Rivers, HQ had continuously deployed detectors to survey upstream conditions, with this estuary area being one of the results.\nBlanketed with spores, this sector proves ideal for mycological research. Regrettably, enemy forces have already established a stronghold here, fortifying the area with exceptionally high defensive measures.\nPrevious detector deployments have alerted the enemy, leaving us limited operational time. Employ the technology researched from Branched Rivers to completely eradicate all their cores and attain critical information regarding [#B32E1B]Flesh-about[] technology.\nHQ will transmit relevant technical data shortly after landing - ensure to take research promptly.\nBe advised that enemy forces periodically activate Javelin pads to summon strike ship reinforcements. Maintain constant anti-air readiness to counter these aerial threats.
