..."[#00FFFF]还没完呢![lightgray]"\n\
四个人的电脑屏幕上同时出现了这行字, 此时他们非常清楚此时该做什么。\n\
"杜尔图斯, 快些开条! "不消说完, 杜尔图斯已经摇好一发『头彩7』, "呲"的一声便开启肾上腺素。\n\
"[#FFD700]正中彩头!!![lightgray]"\n\
杜尔图斯的人物上方冒出大字, 同时人物手中的那把『头彩7』顷刻间便喷涌出大量子弹, 配合肾上腺素的超高增伤, 不断重创着身前这条被盔甲披覆的蠕虫。 再加上其他三人的辅助输出, 蠕虫的血条顷刻见底。\n\
"[#00FFFF]神! 不惧死亡![lightgray]"伴随这条文字出现的, 是蠕虫的身躯缓缓停下的画面, 其身上的盔甲不断离析...\n\
"[#00FFFF]寒霜之月散发着明洁的光辉。[lightgray]"\n\
"[#FFA500]收割之月散布着诡异的光芒。[lightgray]"\n\
"[#FFA500]黑蚀之日蓄势待发。[lightgray]"\n\
"[#AF4BFF]神明吞噬者已被打败![lightgray]"\n\
四人同时欢呼起来。 而后其中一人提议道: "今天的灾厄就玩到这吧, 该去工作了。"\n\
"啊, 快走快走, 正好那把枪, 叫什么『头彩7』, 我正感觉它还挺帅的, 可以试试研发成炮塔。"杜尔图斯附和道。\n\
"你真是疯掉了, 这可是现实生活。 目前对随机弹壳发射器的研究仍然没有进展, 但若抛弃这一点, 那么它和其他霰弹炮塔有何区别?"另一人道。\n\
"不消质疑, 我自有道。"杜尔图斯似乎胸有成竹。\n\
\n\
几个月后, 当杜尔图斯带着他的半成品去大会上展示时, 几乎所有人都被惊掉了下巴----『赌徒』, 一款将弹药碾碎成渣的霰弹发射器。 利用其独特的结构, 弹渣被发射的同时, 又有一部分糊在了炮管中。 久而久之, 每次发射弹药时, 都会将先前留下的一部分附着在壁的弹渣一同发射出去, 做到了"随机"的效果。\n\
当他的作品得以展示后, 会场上议论的声音越来越大, 嘲笑, 质询, 谩骂...各异的声音不绝于耳。 这般的结构设计简直是对与会者和《火种公司第二集团军公约》赤裸的挑衅, 抛开依靠弹药出膛的动能能不能将附着的弹渣冲走不谈, 在枪膛中碾碎弹药是极度危险的, 炮塔若长久使用不炸膛, 那简直是有鬼了。\n\
这样的局面持续了一分钟以上, 杜尔图斯才敢陪着笑脸, 声称他早已做过多轮安全测试, 是没有安全隐患的。 但经过综合评估后, 拥有资历的审查人员还是将其判为"具有中度安全风险的物品", 不予通过大规模投入使用的请求, 并额外取消了杜尔图斯三个月的研发产品权。\n\
审查人员临走时悄悄对杜尔图斯说: "抱歉了兄弟, 不是你给得不够多, 我怕将来有一天被发配到战场上时, 会因为这玩意而意外去世...给你判个中度, 尽我最大能力了, 保重兄弟。"\n\
\n\
这样一来, 杜尔图斯自然是苦了闷了。 后来他迷上抽卡游戏, 但由于选择困难症, 他决定不了先去玩哪个, 便叫上了当初陪他玩灾厄的三个朋友, 欲利用『赌徒』为他做出决定。\n\
"...只剩下我和硬化合金了, 那我选..."最后一个人做出了决定。 这话一出, 余下三个人稍稍惊奇地看向了他。\n\
"算了, 就这样吧, 接下来该试试运气了..."杜尔图斯对着远处的训练用墙体设置好了目标。 随着『赌徒』连续七轮的出膛, 他们心中都已确定了, 这场幸运转盘最后的结果。\n\
一会儿杜尔图斯就下好了游戏。 其实他之前看过别人玩这游戏, 也知道自己启动游戏后会看到什么: 整个电脑屏幕都将是几乎空白一片, 除了中间那两个大黑的艺术字。

This kind of force shield seems more energetic and unstable...\n\
Not only does shield releases lightning if overheated, but also it does:\n\
* Absorbs and controls enemy bullets nearby for a short time.\n\
** Will stop Absorbing if total bullets are able to cause great damage.\n\
* Picks some of bullets, and make them target nearby enemy units. The rest will be fired to every direction randomly.\n\
* Shield keeps heated during this time. Afterwards, it continues to cool down.
