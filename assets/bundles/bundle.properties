# Blocks

block.fire-hzgs.name = Fire Company
block.fire-hzgs.description = The origin of Fire's tech tree.

block.fire-adaptive-source.name = Adaptive Source

block.fire-pooled-neoplasm.name = Neoplasm
block.fire-bloody-dirt.name = Bloody Dirt



# Blocks-Turret

block.fire-js.name = Smasher
block.fire-js.description = Shoots clusters of shells at ground enemy targets over long distances.
block.fire-js.info = Initially researched at Landing Base, used for frontline defense by the enemy.\n\nAs a large early artillery, it is small, inexpensive, and easy to use. As a projectile launcher with a wide range of detections, it is loaded with metaglass shells, which is enough to shatter most low-tier units beyond the enemy's range.\n\nThe only drawback is that it can only have anti-aircraft capabilities after loading with sulflame alloy shells, and it requires manual targeting. But who still uses it by then...

block.fire-yg.name = Nightmare
block.fire-yg.description = Fires overpowered pierce beams at enemy targets rapidly.
block.fire-yg.info = Initially researched at Landing Base, used for frontline defense by the enemy.\n\nIt was researched along with the Smasher, but unlike the former, its ingenious structure allows it to almost melt various types of ammunition. As a high-damage laser emitter, its presence can be seen almost everywhere - from being the main defense to a supporting role in top-level defenses, it handles low-tier units with ease and can overpower high-tier units with numerical advantage.\n\n[teal]Enemies melted by its laser, on the brink of death, finally see that terrifying and eerie light.

block.fire-dr.name = Ignition
block.fire-dr.description = Fires a continuous slow-moving single-target laser at enemy targets.

block.fire-blossom.name = Blossom
block.fire-blossom.description = Fires two seeking cluster-missiles at enemy targets.
block.fire-blossom.info = Initially researched at Beach Landing.\n\nAs a turret that can be deployed using only electricity and is relatively small in size, it has been very popular since its development. It is suitable for dealing with low-tier units, but with numerical superiority and various attack speed bonuses, it also has the ability to take on some high-tier units. However, due to its low-damage and multi-stage attack pattern, it always seems weak and ineffective.\n\nAs a cluster missile launcher, the appearance of its missiles always reminds people of a certain naval unit. And indeed, its designer was once a member of the navy in the first army of the Fire Company. The agile and wide-ranging scouting abilities of the supporting naval units, Cyerce, were highly favored by them... and also caused them hardships of course.

block.fire-gambler.name = Gambler
block.fire-gambler.description = Fires shrapnels at enemy targets.\nIt has a chance to fire a better bullet type depending on the quality of ammo, until using the highest quality ammo.
block.fire-gambler.info = \
...[#00FFFF]It's not over yet![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The four computer screens simultaneously displayed this line of text, and they all knew exactly what to do at this moment.\n\
"Dultrus, ADRENALINE! "Before the sentence was finished, Dultrus had already loaded "The Sevens Striker", with his adrenaline mode activated.\n\
\n\
[#FFD700]Jackpot!!![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The words appeared above Dultrus' character, meanwhile "The Sevens Striker" immediately unleashed a barrage of bullets, coupled with the high damage boost from the adrenaline, constantly inflicting heavy damage on the worm covered in scales in front of them. With the additional support damage from the other three players, the worm's health bar quickly plummeted.\n\
\n\
[#00FFFF]A GOD DOES NOT FEAR DEATH![lightgray]\n\
\n\
Accompanying this message was the scene of the worm's body slowly coming to a stop, with his scales gradually falling apart...\n\
\n\
[#00FFFF]The frigid moon shimmers brightly.[lightgray]\n\
[#FFA500]The harvest moon glows eerily.[lightgray]\n\
[#FFA500]The dark sun awaits.[lightgray]\n\
[#AF4BFF]The devourer of Gods has been defeated![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The four of them cheered at the same time. One of them then suggested, "Let's call it a day for today, we should get back to work."\n\
"Uh, that weapon, called "The Sevens Striker", is pretty cool, and could be developed into a turret." Dultrus said.\n\
"You're really out of your mind, this is real life. Research on the random shell launcher still hasn't made any progress, and if we ignore that and turn it into a normal turret, what's the difference from other shotguns?" another person said.\n\
"Don't question it, I have my ways." Dultrus seemed confident.\n\
\n\
Months later, when Dultrus presented his prototype at a conference, almost everyone was shocked - "Gambler", a shotgun that crushes ammunition into shrapnel. Using its unique structure, while the shrapnel is fired, a part of it also sticks to the barrel. Over time, every time ammunition is fired, the previously left shrapnel attached to the barrel will also be ejected, achieving a "RANDOM" effect.\n\
\n\
After the presentation, voices of discussion, ridicule, questioning, and insults appeared increasingly louder in the conference hall. Such a structural design was a blatant challenge to the attendees and the "Fire Company the Second Army Convention" - leaving aside whether the kinetic energy produced by the ammunition being fired can remove the attached shrapnel, crushing the ammunition in the barrel is extremely dangerous. Used for a long time without exploding, it would be extraordinary.\n\
\n\
This situation lasted for more than a minute, and finally Dultrus declared that he had conducted multiple rounds of safety tests and there were no safety hazards. However, after a comprehensive evaluation, the qualified examiners judged it to be a "product with moderate safety risk" and denied the request for large-scale deployment, additionally cancelling Dultrus' three-month product development rights.\n\
\n\
As the examiners left, one of them quietly said to Dultrus, "Sorry bro, it's not you didn't give enough, but it's I'm afraid that one day if I'm assigned to the battlefield, I might die because of this thing... I did my best to judge it to be "moderate"... take care of yourself."\n\
\n\
As a consequence, Dultrus naturally felt frustrated. Afterwards he became addicted to the gacha game, but due to decision-making difficulties, he couldn't decide which one to play first. So he invited the three friends who had played Calamity with him initially to use "Gambler" to make a decision.\n\
"...I'm only left with the hardened alloy, so I choose..." the last person made the decision. When his words came out, other three people looked at him slightly surprised.\n\
"Fine, let's just go with this..."Dultrus set up the target on a training wall in the distance. With seven consecutive rounds from the "Gambler", they all knew the final outcome of this lucky roulette.\n\
\n\
After a while the game download was fone. As a matter of fact, he had seen others play this game before and knew what he would see after starting the game: the entire computer screen would be almost completely blank, except for the two large black artistic Chinese Characters (原神) in the middle.\n\
[white]Well... that's Genshin Impact. Couldn't find the way to express the exact meaning in Chinese into English... :(

block.fire-dh.name = Seaquake
block.fire-dh.description = Fires overpowered streams of liquid at enemy targets. Automatically extinguishes fires when supplied with water. Requires power.
block.fire-dh.info = Initially researched at Scorching Volcano.\n\nAs a powerful liquid turret developed by the Fire Company, it is widely used internally as an automatic fire extinguisher with outstanding fire prevention effects.\n\nThe following is an interview record:\n\n\
Reporter: Next, I will conduct a series of interviews with you about the "Seaquake", please be prepared.\n\
Eshville: Okay, please blur my name, thank you, since my next remarks may have some negative impact on the "Seaquake".\n\
Reporter: Okay, Mr. Eshville.\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: It was a sunny... um... noon at the time, I was walking alone in a corridor of the company, where there was no one else around...\n\
(The onlookers couldn't help but hold their breath)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: Then I took out a pack of cigarettes, ready to enjoy a pleasant lunch break, and defy the company's no-smoking regulations.\n\
(The onlookers disappointedly booed)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: Just as I was about to light the cigarette, a stream of water suddenly sprayed towards my lighter!!\n\
Reporter: So, this incident is... (interrupted)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: The water stream from the f***ing "Seaquake" directly washed away my cigarette and lighter!!! A mixture of tobacco and glass shards spread on the floor in front of me, leaving me stunned there...\n\
Reporter: So you learnt from it... (interrupted again)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: I will NEVER buy a regular glass lighter from this brand again!!\n\
Reporter: Okay, now we are proud to introduce the new glass lighter from (blocked due to insufficient advertising fees) company...

block.fire-ql.name = Distance
block.fire-ql.description = Launches a powerful missile at ground enemy targets over vast distances.
block.fire-ql.info = Initially researched at Eteriver Stronghold, used as a part of the enemy's forward defense system.\n\nAs one of the rare missile launchers, it has an extremely long detection range and high damage that no other turret in the 3*3-sized series can match, making it effective for both defense and attack.\nHowever, its disadvantage lies in its heavy reliance on cooldowns and overdrive bonuses, as well as its high ammunition consumption.

block.fire-grudge.name = Grudge
block.fire-grudge.description = Fires huge bullets at enemy targets. Highly effective to well-armored units.\n[red]Can't be overdriven for safety reasons.
block.fire-grudge.details = [white]Target! [yellow]Fire! [orange]Rend! [red]Pulverize!
block.fire-grudge.info = Initially researched at Desolate Fortification, deserted in the middle of the area.\nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "Spectre".\n\nThe representative work of the old school - as the superior of the "Spectre", it has all the characteristics of the former: heavy, clumsy but appreciably lethal. Its design compatibility allows it to still use thorium as ammunition, without worrying about saving ammunition expenses, surpassing the modernization faction - "Swarmer" and "Cyclone", which only use surge alloy ammunition. For wealthier situations, it still provides a better choice, using detonation mixture or even hardened alloy.\n\nUnder the coolant supply, the performance of advanced ammunition is excellent, able to easily shred solitary enemy units. Sufficient "Grudge" even makes the "Apollo" fleet turn back.\nHowever, despite its high upper limit, its barrel heating issue has not been properly resolved, leading to its performance without coolant being even worse than some 2*2-sized turrets.\n\nObjectively speaking, "Grudge" is still one of the most cost-effective turrets. To this day it's still widely used in Fire Company, and it has set the record of destructing 10 "Reign" mechs when supplied with hardened alloy and cryofluid, which is the best proof.

block.fire-magnetic-sphere.name = Magnetic Sphere
block.fire-magnetic-sphere.description = Fires a charged, decelerated sphere at aerial enemy targets.\nThe sphere will detect whether there's a target nearby and release directional lightning attacking target.\nThe sphere will select and chase a target nearby if it comes to the end.

block.fire-magnetic-rail.name = [WiP]Magnetic Rail
block.fire-magnetic-rail.description = Electromagnetic railgun. Requires really-massive amounts of power.\n[red][WiP][]



# Blocks-Production

block.fire-fmj.name = Chopper
block.fire-fmj.description = When placed facing a tree, chops and outputs timber indefinitely.

block.fire-sc.name = Tree Farm
block.fire-sc.description = Breeds trees with water, and processes it into timber.

block.fire-sqlnq.name = Vapour Condenser
block.fire-sqlnq.description = Collects a large amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, and condenses it into water. Require large amounts of power.

block.fire-swzzsj.name = Biomass Cultivator
block.fire-swzzsj.description = Collects tiny concentrations of atmospheric spores, and cultivates them into spore pods with advanced technology. More efficient than cultivator.
block.fire-swzzsj.info = Initially researched at Spore Fiord, located at the site of power generators.\nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "Cultivator".\n\n[lightgray]The fate of this planet being contaminated by these organisms was already destined...\nThe indigenous people of Planet Risetar had indeed put effort into developing such technology, indicating that they had worked hard and made attempts to control the spread of spores. However, these intelligent, dangerous organisms are inherently uncontrollable, and we no longer find the later [#B32E1B]"Tragic Result"[] surprising.

block.fire-lbzt.name = Fission Drill
block.fire-lbzt.description = Uses a large amount of thorium to lead to fissions, leading ores escape from its position. (I'm kidding)



# Blocks-Distribution

composite.info = \nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "{0}".\n\nAs the superior of "{0}", it can perfectly adapt to the former, once again proving the claim that "Risetar Tech originates from Serpulo" without words.\n\nOnce the composite distribution components family was developed, it was immediately put into large-scale use, receiving countless praises - more cost-effective, better to use, more durable, and more powerful than their inferior.\n\nHowever, their inferior have not been eliminated: units without intermediate and above construction permits are not allowed to use composite distribution components, so they still serve as teaching tools for beginners. In addition, small integrated facilities also try to avoid using composite distribution components to avoid excessive costs...

block.fire-fhcsd.name = Composite Conveyor
block.fire-fhcsd.description = Transports items forward.\nFaster than a titanium conveyor.
block.fire-fhcsd.info = Initially researched at Corner of Zero, located at the site of thorium ore occurrence.

block.fire-hardened-alloy-conveyor.name = Hardened Alloy Conveyor
block.fire-hardened-alloy-conveyor.description = Transports items forward in batches. Accepts items at the back, and unloads them in three directions at the front. Requires multiple loading and unloading points for peak throughput.\nFaster than a plastanium conveyor.

block.fire-composite-bridge-conveyor.name = Composite Bridge Conveyor
block.fire-composite-bridge-conveyor.description = Instantly transports items over terrain or buildings.\nLonger range than the item bridge.
block.fire-composite-bridge-conveyor.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.



# Blocks-Liquid

block.fire-composite-liquid-router.name = Composite Liquid Router
block.fire-composite-liquid-router.description = Accepts liquids from one direction and outputs them to up to 3 other directions equally. Can also store a sizeable amount of liquid.
block.fire-composite-liquid-router.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.

block.fire-composite-bridge-conduit.name = Composite Bridge Conduit
block.fire-composite-bridge-conduit.description = Transports liquids over terrain or buildings.\nLonger range than the bridge conduit.
block.fire-composite-bridge-conduit.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.



# Blocks-Power

block.fire-zjjd.name = Conductor Power Node
block.fire-zjjd.description = A long-range power node with fewer available connections than large power node. Can store an amount of power.

block.fire-yrfdj.name = Flame Generator
block.fire-yrfdj.description = Burns high-flammable materials to generate power. Requires cryofluid as coolant.
block.fire-yrfdj.info = Initially researched at Chilly Mountains, found abandoned at a water pit site.\n\nThe climate conditions in Chilly Mountains are extremely harsh, and traditional fire-based generators are of no use here. However, it can easily handle power generation tasks - this is because it only burns high-performance fuel and can guarantee normal operation while providing a large amount of power. \nDue to its sincere building materials and ingenious structural design, its use cases are extremely wide-ranging, from large-scale modular use to bulk use. The only drawback is that its energy conversion efficiency seems to be not very high, with a considerable amount of energy being converted into heat and lost. Therefore, compared to its sister - differential generators, it also requires additional coolant expenses.

block.fire-hydroelectric-generator.name=Hydroelectric Generator
block.fire-hydroelectric-generator.description=Using water flow to impact fan blades to generate electricity, the faster the water flow velocity, the greater the power generation.
block.fire-hydroelectric-generator.detail=It is interesting that its power generation actually depends on the variance of the liquid depth below. Why is this value related to the water flow velocity.

block.fire-burst-reactor.name = Burst Reactor
block.fire-burst-reactor.description = uwu



# Blocks-Defense

block.fire-sbq.name = Dam Wall
block.fire-sbq.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Can only be placed on water.

block.fire-sbqdx.name = Large Dam Wall
block.fire-sbqdx.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Can only be placed on water.

block.fire-hardened-wall.name = Hardened Wall
block.fire-hardened-wall.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Absorbs lasers and electric arcs. Blocks automatic power connections.\nCan be placed on liquids.\n\n[sky]The less health it has, the higher armor it has.

block.fire-hardened-wall-large.name = Large Hardened Wall

block.fire-xrq.name = Flesh Wall
block.fire-xrq.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Has the ability to repair itself. Optionally uses water to boost efficiency.\nReflects most bullets upon impact, [sky]repairs itself depending on bullet damage.



# Blocks-Crafting

block.fire-rnyl.name = Thermal Kiln
block.fire-rnyl.description = Smelts sand and coal into glass. More efficient in hot locations.

block.fire-dgj.name = Metaglass Plater
block.fire-dgj.description = Plates glass with lead into metaglass.

block.fire-dmj.name = Mirrorglass Polisher

block.fire-detonation-mixer.name = Detonation Mixer
block.fire-detonation-mixer.description = Mixes pyratite and blast compound into detonation compound.\nRequires logic alloy to control the explosion.

block.fire-gslqq.name = Slag Cooler
block.fire-gslqq.description = Produces flamefluid crystal by cooling a large amount of slag.
block.fire-gslqq.info = Initially researched at Scorching Volcano, found abandoned next to the surface lava flow.\n\nHas the ability to cool down the scorching fluid to the crystal - through the low temperature provided by cryofluid. Under normal circumstances, the cooled scorching fluid would only turn into stone, but it can produce crystals with a translucent appearance. The flowing fluid can still be vaguely seen within, emitting a bright red light in the dark.\n\nDue to the temperature, a large amount of steam is emitted during operation. Workers often take advantage of this, openly violating the "NO SMOKING during work hours" regulation, lighting tobacco while the machine is working and letting the smoke rings follow the steam to be emitted...

block.fire-tqjsj.name = Crusher
block.fire-tqjsj.description = Crushes copper and lead into scrap. Used in locations with no surface scrap available.

block.fire-timber-burner.name = Timber Burner
block.fire-timber-burner.description = Burns timber into coal. Generates power.

block.fire-drgl.name = Electrothermal Silicon Furnace
block.fire-drgl.description = Refines silicon from sand. Requires massive amounts of power.
block.fire-drgl.info = Initially researched at Corner of Zero, the relevant research information was provided by allied forces stationed there.\n\nAs a electrothermal type factory, its working method follows the principle of simplicity. It only needs electricity to refine the input crude sand into refined silicon products, and controls material loss to an acceptable range.\nBut this was enough to make it stand out. Previous generations of engineers had all attempted to improve the old silicon furnace, but all ended in failure. Flammable materials were needed to provide the temperature required for refining, otherwise, the quality of the silicon product would not be qualified.\nAfter obtaining its design prototype and finished product, the engineers were all amazed by the wisdom of its developer, and decided unanimously to put it into large-scale application directly. At the same time, there were rumors about the indigenous people of Planet Risetar controlling alien technology...\nBut look at the exaggerated power usage... an energy crisis might be triggered?

block.fire-flesh-synthesizer.name = Flesh Synthesizer
block.fire-flesh-synthesizer.description = Synthesizes flesh from plastanium, phase fabric and spore pod.

block.fire-ydysj.name = Liquid Nitrogen Compressor
block.fire-ydysj.description = Collects nitrogen in atmospheric. Uses blast compound and kindling alloy to create high-pressure conditions, requires large amount of cryofluid as coolant, compressing nitrogen into liquid nitrogen.

block.fire-hardened-alloy-smelter.name = Hardened Alloy Smelter

block.fire-magnetic-alloy-former.name = Magnetic Alloy Former
block.fire-magnetic-alloy-former.description = Forms surge alloy, conductor and hardened alloy into magnetic alloy.

block.fire-electromagnetism-diffuser.name = Electromagnetism Diffuser
block.fire-electromagnetism-diffuser.description = Diffuses electromagnetism from magnetic alloy onto flamefluid crystal, forming surge alloy.

block.fire-hardened-alloy-crucible.name = Hardened Alloy Crucible
block.fire-hardened-alloy-crucible.description = Fuses thorium, plastanium into hardened alloy. Requires really-massive amounts of power to create high-temperature conditions.\n[red]Will explode violently if there's another crucible producing nearby, or destroyed while producing.[]\n\n"More efficient, more dangerous... More deadly."
block.fire-hardened-alloy-crucible.info = Initially researched at Desolate Fortification.\n\n...The original codename for the action at Desolate Fortification marsh was "Urgent Support". "Support" actually refers to "supporting to research the Hardened Alloy Crucible". This action was the only way for allied forces to obtain information about the factory...\nThe almost crazy structural design. Input apart from the basic thorium and plastanium, water and excessive electricity are used instead of kindling alloy to heat. Against the backdrop of the dwindling expenditure on the kindling alloy production line, this was the only way out.\n\nFor this, work is not a fun thing - a large amount of power supply causes the factory's electric meter to reverse and also leads to a huge release of heat. Using a large amount of water to assist in heat dissipation is extremely poor... for it, this is just enough. In the high-temperature and high-pressure overloaded environment, the energy surge brought about by production is inevitable. Metal ion-colored lightning may even occasionally be emitted from the smoke exhaust fan, with the color depending on the main components in the smoke at the time.\n\nThe enormous heat released during work makes it ignorant of what winter is, unfortunately few people can use it for warmth - its structure dictates its high instability, and in [teal]rare cases[] may even trigger [scarlet]a disaster[]. The radioactivity of the thorium raw materials adds another layer of deathly veil, and only a few assigned workers can approach it for operation and maintenance.\n\n[lightgray]As for the rare situations mentioned... hope never encounter them.



# Blocks-Units

block.fire-flesh-reconstructor.name = Flesh Reconstructor
block.fire-flesh-reconstructor.description = Produces blade units. Output units can be used directly, or moved into reconstructors for upgrading.\n[red]Can only be placed on bloody dirt.

\n\
/* ================ */\n\
\n\
File Number: FNP-003\n\
Time: Inuit November 23, 2113\n\
Location: Fire Company, Interrogation Room No. 010 Basement\n\
\n\
The interrogator calmly took out a box of cigarettes from his pocket, lit one, and asked: "What was your motive for releasing the Flesh?"\n\
The old man sitting across from the interrogator seemed to be choked by the smoke, coughed twice, and slowly began to speak:\n\
"When I was a child, I wanted to be everything.\n\
"I wanted to be the chief senator of Fire Company, I wanted to be the President of the Inuit Federation, I wanted to be the commander of the third army of the Fire Company, I wanted to build my beautiful mother planet, Chael.\n\
"As I grew older, I wanted to be a soldier, an engineer, and create value for society."\n\
The interrogator interrupted: "Enough, stop talking about your young life. As a retiring senior interrogator of Fire Company, I can tell you responsibly, no one would risk being cut in half by a huge magnetic sphere to save a human traitor."\n\
The old man smiled and said: "If that's the case, why rush me? Just eager to get off work, I suppose."\n\
He continued:\n\
"When I went to college on Inuit, I found I had changed.\n\
"I wanted to be a freelance mercenary, a spaceship pilot, and I even considered becoming a wandering poet traveling the mountains and rivers of Inuit.\n\
"But in the end, I couldn't become the person I wanted to be... I was just an ordinary technician."\n\
The interrogator couldn't help but interrupt again: "...What's wrong with being a technician? I used to be a technician..."\n\
The old man ignored:\n\
"I've been a technician for twenty years, never took a day off... I worked day and night, had countless heartaches, and I even suspected I would die suddenly... But I didn't, I survived with the belief of taking revenge on this heartless company...\n\
"One day, I saw it trapped in a jar...\n\
"I looked at it and felt like we were so similar... one oppressed at the work position, the other tormented in a bottle...\n\
"Whether out of sympathy or something else, I smashed that jar...\n\
"What happened afterwards, I don't need to repeat."\n\
Interrogator: "Did you ever consider the consequences of doing that? Do you know what the phrase 'the one who is excluded to my clan must be a traitor' means?!"\n\
The old man laughed, tinged with madness:\n\
"You treat the lower-level employees worse than f***ing livestock... every time my leave request was rejected, I thought about those so-called rare animals, they spend all day eating and sleeping, but we have to work non-stop and get laid off when the time comes, then wander the streets, no one cares until we die from starvation or cold... Where are your so-called f***ing 'human rights'?!\n\
"'The one who is excluded to my clan must be a traitor', it's just an excuse you use to oppress other beings...\n\
"...你知道什么是狼狈为奸吗? 狼和狈其实是同一种动物, 而狈是失去行动能力的狼, ...就连被你们大肆屠杀的动物都有互帮互助的意识, 你们人类又为何自相残杀!"\n\
审讯员眯了眯眼: "所谓你们人类..."\n\
(Some of the texts in this part have not been translated, since I couldn't find the way to express the exact meaning in Chinese into English.)\n\
The old man said nothing more.\n\
The interrogator clapped his hands: "Well, it seems you can't provide any valuable information..."\n\
At that moment, the old man suddenly convulsed.\n\
His limbs began to thicken and lengthen, and his entire body seemed to be filled with rapidly growing tumors, quickly expanding to fill half of the interrogation room.\n\
The defense system on the wall of the interrogation room activated in time, and several "ignition" turrets instantly burned the Monster in the interrogation room to ashes.\n\
\n\
/* ================ */\n\
\n\
An intern who arrived later, on his way back after completing the cleaning task, marveled to his colleagues: "This thing can actually infect metal! It's really amazing. Just now when I was disinfecting, that piece of metal plate even tried to crawl up and knock me dead!"

sector.fire-lava-stronghold.description = Having disintegrated the enemy forces in Scorching Volcano, it's time to deal a counter-blow to the North Pole.\nEnemy forces have built a complete defence here, and coupled the high temperature here, large allied units were unable to be delivered here, making the stronghold hard to capture.\n\nHowever, remember the [accent]blue, light strike ships[white] in Desolate Fortification? They were actually the elite units seized by allied forces in the latest attack here.\nAnyway, flying detector has found the equipment used to summon these strike ships here.\n\nAllied forces have established a base here.
