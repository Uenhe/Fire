# Blocks

block.fire-hzgs.name = Fire Company
block.fire-hzgs.description = The origin of Fire's tech tree.

block.fire-adaptive-source.name = Adaptive Source

block.fire-pooled-neoplasm.name = Neoplasm
block.fire-bloody-dirt.name = Bloody Dirt



# Blocks-Turret

block.fire-js.name = Smasher
block.fire-js.description = Shoots clusters of shells at ground enemy targets over long distances.
block.fire-js.info = Initially researched at Landing Base, used for frontline defense by the enemy.\n\nAs a large early artillery, it is small in size, inexpensive, and easy to use. As a projectile launcher with a wide range of detection, it is loaded with metaglass shells, which is enough to shatter most low-tier units beyond the enemy's range.\n\nThe only drawback is that it can only have anti-aircraft capabilities after loading with sulflame alloy shells, and it requires manual targeting. But who still uses it by then...

block.fire-yg.name = Nightmare
block.fire-yg.description = Fires overpowered pierce beams at enemy targets rapidly.
block.fire-yg.info = Initially researched at Landing Base, used for frontline defense by the enemy.\n\nIt was researched along with the Smasher, but unlike the former, its ingenious structure allows it to almost melt various types of ammunition. As a high-damage laser emitter, its presence can be seen almost everywhere - from being the main defense to a supporting role in top-level defenses, it handles low-tier units with ease and can overpower high-tier units with numerical advantage.\n\n[teal]Enemies melted by its laser, on the brink of death, finally see that terrifying and eerie light.

block.fire-dr.name = Ignite
block.fire-dr.description = Fires a continuous slow-moving single-target laser at enemy targets.

block.fire-blossom.name = Blossom
block.fire-blossom.description = Fires two seeking cluster-missiles at enemy targets.
block.fire-blossom.info = Initially researched at Beach Landing.\n\nAs a turret that can be deployed using only electricity and is relatively small in size, it has been very popular since its development. It is suitable for dealing with low-tier units, but with numerical superiority and various attack speed bonuses, it also has the ability to take on some high-tier units. However, due to its low damage and multi-stage attack pattern, it always seems weak and ineffective.\n\nAs a cluster missile launcher, the appearance of its missiles always reminds people of a certain naval unit. And indeed, its designer was once a member of the navy in the first army of the Fire Company. The agile and wide-ranging scouting abilities of the supporting naval units, Cyerce, were highly favored by them... and also caused them hardships of course.

block.fire-gambler.name = Gambler
block.fire-gambler.description = Fires shrapnels at enemy targets.\nIt has a chance to fire a better bullet type depending on the quality of ammo, until using the highest quality ammo.
block.fire-gambler.info = \
...[#00FFFF]It's not over yet![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The four computer screens simultaneously displayed this line of text, and they all knew exactly what to do at this moment.\n\
"Dultrus, ADRENALINE! "Before the sentence was finished, Dultrus had already loaded "The Sevens Striker", with his adrenaline mode activated.\n\
\n\
[#FFD700]Jackpot!!![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The words appeared above Dultrus' character, meanwhile "The Sevens Striker" immediately unleashed a barrage of bullets, coupled with the high damage boost from the adrenaline, constantly inflicting heavy damage on the worm covered in scales in front of them. With the additional support damage from the other three players, the worm's health bar quickly plummeted.\n\
\n\
[#00FFFF]A GOD DOES NOT FEAR DEATH![lightgray]\n\
\n\
Accompanying this message was the scene of the worm's body slowly coming to a stop, with his scales gradually falling apart...\n\
\n\
[#00FFFF]The frigid moon shimmers brightly.[lightgray]\n\
[#FFA500]The harvest moon glows eerily.[lightgray]\n\
[#FFA500]The dark sun awaits.[lightgray]\n\
[#AF4BFF]The devourer of Gods has been defeated![lightgray]\n\
\n\
The four of them cheered at the same time. One of them then suggested, "Let's call it a day for today, we should get back to work."\n\
"Uh, that weapon, called "The Sevens Striker", is pretty cool, and could be developed into a turret." Dultrus said.\n\
"You're really out of your mind, this is real life. Research on the random shell launcher still hasn't made any progress, and if we ignore that and turn it into a normal turret, what's the difference from other shotguns?" another person said.\n\
"Don't question it, I have my ways." Dultrus seemed confident.\n\
\n\
Months later, when Dultrus presented his prototype at a conference, almost everyone was shocked - "Gambler", a shotgun that crushes ammunition into shrapnel. Using its unique structure, while the shrapnel is fired, a part of it also sticks to the barrel. Over time, every time ammunition is fired, the previously left shrapnel attached to the barrel will also be ejected, achieving a "RANDOM" effect.\n\
\n\
After the presentation, voices of discussion, ridicule, questioning, and insults appeared increasingly louder in the conference hall. Such a structural design was a blatant challenge to the attendees and the "Fire Company the Second Army Convention" - leaving aside whether the kinetic energy produced by the ammunition being fired can remove the attached shrapnel, crushing the ammunition in the barrel is extremely dangerous. Used for a long time without exploding, it would be extraordinary.\n\
\n\
This situation lasted for more than a minute, and finally Dultrus declare that he had conducted multiple rounds of safety tests and there were no safety hazards. However, after a comprehensive evaluation, the qualified examiners judged it to be a "product with moderate safety risk" and denied the request for large-scale deployment, additionally cancelling Dultrus' three-month product development rights.\n\
\n\
As the examiners left, one of them quietly said to Dultrus, "Sorry bro, it's not you didn't give enough, but it's I'm afraid that one day if I'm assigned to the battlefield, I might die because of this thing... I did my best to judge it to be "moderate"... take care of yourself."\n\
\n\
As a consequence, Dultrus naturally felt frustrated. Afterwards he became addicted to the gacha game, but due to decision-making difficulties, he couldn't decide which one to play first. So he invited the three friends who had played Calamity with him initially to use "Gambler" to make a decision.\n\
"...I'm only left with the hardened alloy, so I choose..." the last person made the decision. When his words came out, other three people looked at him slightly surprised.\n\
"Fine, let's just go with this..."Dultrus set up the target on a training wall in the distance. With seven consecutive rounds from the "Gambler", they all knew the final outcome of this lucky roulette.\n\
\n\
After a while the game download was fone. As a matter of fact, he had seen others play this game before and knew what he would see after starting the game: the entire computer screen would be almost completely blank, except for the two large black artistic Chinese Characters (原神) in the middle.\n\
[white]Well... that's Genshin Impact. Couldn't find the way to express the exact meaning in Chinese into English... :(

block.fire-dh.name = Seaquake
block.fire-dh.description = Fires overpowered streams of liquid at enemy targets. Automatically extinguishes fires when supplied with water. Requires power.
block.fire-dh.info = Initially researched at Scorching Volcano.\n\nAs a powerful liquid turret developed by the Fire Company, it is widely used internally as an automatic fire extinguisher with outstanding fire prevention effects.\n\nThe following is an interview record:\n\n\
Reporter: Next, I will conduct a series of interviews with you about the "Seaquake", please be prepared.\n\
Eshville: Okay, please blur my name, thank you, since my next remarks may have some negative impact on the "Seaquake".\n\
Reporter: Okay, Mr. Eshville.\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: It was a sunny... um... noon at the time, I was walking alone in a corridor of the company, where there was no one else around...\n\
(The onlookers couldn't help but hold their breath)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: Then I took out a pack of cigarettes, ready to enjoy a pleasant lunch break, and defy the company's no-smoking regulations.\n\
(The onlookers disappointedly booed)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: Just as I was about to light the cigarette, a stream of water suddenly sprayed towards my lighter!!\n\
Reporter: So, this incident is... (interrupted)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: The water stream from the f***ing "Seaquake" directly washed away my cigarette and lighter!!! A mixture of tobacco and glass shards spread on the floor in front of me, leaving me stunned there...\n\
Reporter: So you learnt from it... (interrupted again)\n\
Esh Mosaic Ville: I will NEVER buy a regular glass lighter from this brand again!!\n\
Reporter: Okay, now we are proud to introduce the new glass lighter from (blocked due to insufficient advertising fees) company...

block.fire-ql.name = Distance
block.fire-ql.description = Launches a powerful missile at ground enemy targets over vast distances.
block.fire-ql.info = Initially researched at Eteriver Stronghold, used as a part of the enemy's forward defense system.\n\nAs one of the rare missile launchers, it has an extremely long detection range and high damage that no other turret in the 3*3-sized series can match, making it effective for both defense and attack.\nHowever, its disadvantage lies in its heavy reliance on cooldowns and overdrive bonuses, as well as its high ammunition consumption.

block.fire-grudge.name = Grudge
block.fire-grudge.description = Fires huge bullets at enemy targets. Highly effective to well-armored units.\n[red]Can't be overdriven for safety reasons.
block.fire-grudge.details = [white]Target! [yellow]Fire! [orange]Rend! [red]Pulverize!
block.fire-grudge.info = Initially researched at Desolate Fortification, deserted in the middle of the area.\nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "Spectre".\n\nThe representative work of the old school - as the superior of the "Spectre", it has all the characteristics of the former: heavy, clumsy but appreciably lethal. Its design compatibility allows it to still use thorium as ammunition, without worrying about saving ammunition expenses, surpassing the modernization faction - "Swarmer" and "Cyclone", which only use surge alloy ammunition. For wealthier situations, it still provides a better choice, using detonation mixture or even hardened alloy.\n\nUnder the coolant supply, the performance of advanced ammunition is excellent, able to easily shred solitary enemy units. Sufficient "Grudge" even makes the "Apollo" fleet turn back.\nHowever, despite its high upper limit, its barrel heating issue has not been properly resolved, leading to its performance without coolant being even worse than some 2*2-sized turrets.\n\nObjectively speaking, "Grudge" is still one of the most cost-effective turrets. To this day it's still widely used in Fire Company, and it has set the record of destructing 10 "Reign" mechs when supplied with hardened alloy and cryofluid, which is the best proof.

block.fire-magnetic-sphere.name = Magnetic Sphere
block.fire-magnetic-sphere.description = Fires a charged, decelerated sphere at aerial enemy targets.\nThe sphere will detect whether there's a target nearby and release directional lightning attacking target.\nThe sphere will select and chase a target nearby if it comes to the end.

block.fire-magnetic-rail.name = [WiP]Magnetic Rail
block.fire-magnetic-rail.description = Electromagnetic railgun. Requires really-massive amounts of power.\n[red][WiP][]

block.fire-fmj.description = When placed facing a tree, chops and outputs timber indefinitely.

block.fire-sc.name = Tree Farm
block.fire-sc.description = Breeds trees with water, and processes it into timber.

block.fire-sqlnq.name = Vapour Condenser
block.fire-sqlnq.description = Collects a large amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, and condenses it into water. Require large amounts of power.

block.fire-swzzsj.name = Biomass Cultivator
block.fire-swzzsj.description = Collects tiny concentrations of atmospheric spores, and cultivates them into spore pods with advanced technology. More efficient than cultivator.
block.fire-swzzsj.info = Initially researched at Spore Fiord, located at the site of power generators.\nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "Cultivator".\n\n[lightgray]The fate of this planet being contaminated by these organisms was already destined...\nThe indigenous people of Planet Risetar had indeed put effort into developing such technology, indicating that they had worked hard and made attempts to control the spread of spores. However, these intelligent, dangerous organisms are inherently uncontrollable, and we no longer find the later [#B32E1B]"Tragic Result"[] surprising.

block.fire-lbzt.name = Fission Drill
block.fire-lbzt.description = Uses a large amount of thorium to lead to fissions, leading ores escape from its position. (I'm kidding)



# Blocks-Distribution

composite.info = \nAlso the superior of Serpulo Tech "{0}".\n\nAs the superior of "{0}", it can perfectly adapt to the former, once again proving the claim that "Risetar Tech originates from Serpulo" without words.\n\nOnce the composite distribution components family was developed, it was immediately put into large-scale use, receiving countless praises - more cost-effective, better to use, more durable, and more powerful than their inferior.\n\nHowever, their inferior have not been eliminated: units without intermediate and above construction permits are not allowed to use composite distribution components, so they still serve as teaching tools for beginners. In addition, small integrated facilities also try to avoid using composite distribution components to avoid excessive costs...

block.fire-fhcsd.name = Composite Conveyor
block.fire-fhcsd.description = Transports items forward.\nFaster than a titanium conveyor.
block.fire-fhcsd.info = Initially researched at Corner of Zero, located at the site of thorium ore occurrence.

block.fire-hardened-alloy-conveyor.name = Hardened Alloy Conveyor
block.fire-hardened-alloy-conveyor.description = Transports items forward in batches. Accepts items at the back, and unloads them in three directions at the front. Requires multiple loading and unloading points for peak throughput.\nFaster than a plastanium conveyor.

block.fire-composite-bridge-conveyor.name = Composite Bridge Conveyor
block.fire-composite-bridge-conveyor.description = Instantly transports items over terrain or buildings.\nLonger range than the item bridge.
block.fire-composite-bridge-conveyor.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.



# Blocks-Liquid

block.fire-composite-liquid-router.name = Composite Liquid Router
block.fire-composite-liquid-router.description = Accepts liquids from one direction and outputs them to up to 3 other directions equally. Can also store a sizeable amount of liquid.
block.fire-composite-liquid-router.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.

block.fire-composite-bridge-conduit.name = Composite Bridge Conduit
block.fire-composite-bridge-conduit.description = Transports liquids over terrain or buildings.\nLonger range than the bridge conduit.
block.fire-composite-bridge-conduit.info = Initially researched at Dark Workshop, discovered among the enemy's network of dizzying distribution facilities.



# Blocks-Power

block.fire-zjjd.name = Conductor Power Node
block.fire-zjjd.description = A long-range power node with fewer available connections than large power node. Can store an amount of power.

block.fire-yrfdj.name = Flame Generator
block.fire-yrfdj.description = Burns high-flammable materials to generate power. Requires cryofluid as coolant.
block.fire-yrfdj.info = Initially researched at Chilly Mountains, found abandoned at a water pit site.\n\nThe climate conditions in Chilly Mountains are extremely harsh, and traditional fire-based generators are of no use here. However, it can easily handle power generation tasks - this is because it only burns high-performance fuel and can guarantee normal operation while providing a large amount of power. \nDue to its sincere building materials and ingenious structural design, its use cases are extremely wide-ranging, from large-scale modular use to bulk use. The only drawback is that its energy conversion efficiency seems to be not very high, with a considerable amount of energy being converted into heat and lost. Therefore, compared to its sister - differential generators, it also requires additional coolant expenses.

block.fire-burst-reactor.name = Burst Reactor
block.fire-burst-reactor.description = uwu



# Blocks-Defense

block.fire-sbq.name = Dam Wall
block.fire-sbq.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Can only be placed on water.

block.fire-sbqdx.name = Large Dam Wall
block.fire-sbqdx.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Can only be placed on water.

block.fire-hardened-wall.name = Hardened Wall
block.fire-hardened-wall.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Absorbs lasers and electric arcs. Blocks automatic power connections.\nCan be placed on liquids.\n\n[sky]The less health it has, the higher armor it has.

block.fire-hardened-wall-large.name = Large Hardened Wall
block.fire-hardened-wall-large.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Absorbs lasers and electric arcs. Blocks automatic power connections.\nCan be placed on liquids.\n\n[sky]The less health it has, the higher armor it has.

block.fire-xrq.name = Flesh Wall
block.fire-xrq.description = Protects structures from enemy projectiles. Has the ability to repair itself. Optionally uses water to boost efficiency.\nReflects most bullets upon impact, [sky]repairs itself depending on bullet damage.

block.fire-dgj.name = Metaglass Plater
block.fire-dgj.description = Plates glass with lead into metaglass.

block.fire-dmj.name = Mirrorglass Polisher

block.fire-detonation-mixer.name = Detonation Mixer
block.fire-detonation-mixer.description = Mixes pyratite and blast compound into detonation compound.\nRequires logic alloy to control the explosion.

block.fire-gslqq.name = Slag Cooler
block.fire-gslqq.description = Produces flamefluid crystal by cooling a large amount of slag.
block.fire-gslqq.info = Initially researched at Scorching Volcano, found abandoned next to the surface lava flow.\n\nHas the ability to cool down the scorching fluid to the crystal - through the low temperature provided by cryofluid. Under normal circumstances, the cooled scorching fluid would only turn into stone, but it can produce crystals with a translucent appearance. The flowing fluid can still be vaguely seen within, emitting a bright red light in the dark.\n\nDue to the temperature, a large amount of steam is emitted during operation. Workers often take advantage of this, openly violating the "NO SMOKING during work hours" regulation, lighting tobacco while the machine is working and letting the smoke rings follow the steam to be emitted...

block.fire-tqjsj.name = Crusher
block.fire-tqjsj.description = Crushes copper and lead into scrap. Used in locations with no surface scrap available.

block.fire-timber-burner.name = Timber Burner
block.fire-timber-burner.description = Burns timber into coal. Generates power.

block.fire-drgl.name = Electrothermal Silicon Furnace
block.fire-drgl.description = Refines silicon from sand. Requires massive amounts of power.
block.fire-drgl.info = Initially researched at Corner of Zero, the relevant research information was provided by allied forces stationed there.\n\nAs a electrothermal type factory, its working method follows the principle of simplicity. It only needs electricity to refine the input crude sand into refined silicon products, and controls material loss to an acceptable range.\nBut this was enough to make it stand out. Previous generations of engineers had all attempted to improve the old silicon furnace, but all ended in failure. Flammable materials were needed to provide the temperature required for refining, otherwise, the quality of the silicon product would not be qualified.\nAfter obtaining its design prototype and finished product, the engineers were all amazed by the wisdom of its developer, and decided unanimously to put it into large-scale application directly. At the same time, there were rumors about the indigenous people of Planet Risetar controlling alien technology...\nBut look at the exaggerated power usage... an energy crisis might be triggered?

block.fire-flesh-synthesizer.name = Flesh Synthesizer
block.fire-flesh-synthesizer.description = Synthesizes flesh from plastanium, phase fabric and spore pod.

block.fire-ydysj.name = Liquid Nitrogen Compressor
block.fire-ydysj.description = Collects nitrogen in atmospheric. Uses blast compound and kindling alloy to create high-pressure conditions, requires large amount of cryofluid as coolant, compressing nitrogen into liquid nitrogen.

block.fire-hardened-alloy-smelter.name = Hardened Alloy Smelter
block.fire-hardened-alloy-smelter.description = Fuses thorium, plastanium and kindling alloy into hardened alloy.

block.fire-magnetic-alloy-former.name = Magnetic Alloy Former
block.fire-magnetic-alloy-former.description = Forms surge alloy, conductor and hardened alloy into magnetic alloy.

block.fire-electromagnetism-diffuser.name = Electromagnetism Diffuser
block.fire-electromagnetism-diffuser.description = Diffuses electromagnetism from magnetic alloy onto flamefluid crystal, forming surge alloy.

block.fire-hardened-alloy-crucible.name = Hardened Alloy Crucible
block.fire-hardened-alloy-crucible.description = Fuses thorium, plastanium into hardened alloy. Requires really-massive amounts of power to create high-temperature conditions.\n[red]Will explode violently if there's another crucible producing nearby, or destroyed while producing.[]\n\n"More efficient, more dangerous... More deadly."
block.fire-hardened-alloy-crucible.info = Initially researched at Desolate Fortification.\n\n...The original codename for the action at Desolate Fortification marsh was "Urgent Support". "Support" actually refers to "supporting to research the Hardened Alloy Crucible". This action was the only way for allied forces to obtain information about the factory...\nThe almost crazy structural design. Input apart from the basic thorium and plastanium, water and excessive electricity are used instead of kindling alloy to heat. Against the backdrop of the dwindling expenditure on the kindling alloy production line, this was the only way out.\n\nFor this, work is not a fun thing - a large amount of power supply causes the factory's electric meter to reverse and also leads to a huge release of heat. Using a large amount of water to assist in heat dissipation is extremely poor... for it, this is just enough. In the high-temperature and high-pressure overloaded environment, the energy surge brought about by production is inevitable. Metal ion-colored lightning may even occasionally be emitted from the smoke exhaust fan, with the color depending on the main components in the smoke at the time.\n\nThe enormous heat released during work makes it ignorant of what winter is, unfortunately few people can use it for warmth - its structure dictates its high instability, and in [teal]rare cases[] may even trigger[scarlet]a disaster[]. The radioactivity of the thorium raw materials adds another layer of deathly veil, and only a few assigned workers can approach it for operation and maintenance.\n\n[lightgray]As for the rare situations mentioned... hope never encounter them.



# Blocks-Units

block.fire-flesh-reconstructor.name = Flesh Reconstructor
block.fire-flesh-reconstructor.description = Produces blade units. Output units can be used directly, or moved into reconstructors for upgrading.\n[red]Can only be placed on bloody dirt.

After the war, the Fire Company cleanup team arrived here and found a partially engraved "Pioneer" type air unit with the Fire Company debris...\nAccording to the direction of the debris, it can be recognized that there was debris of an enemy-owned Surge Smelter and an Fire Company "Quad" unit behind the original Pioneer's direction of advance, suspected to have activated the Pioneer's dash ability before crashing, attracting the firepower of the enemy-owned Apollo's first attack, causing the subsequent "Quad" group that arrived not to be quickly destroyed by the enemy unit, but to fly over and detonate with the enemy's Surge Smelter.

\n\
/* ================ */\n\
\n\
编号: FNP-003\n\
时间: 因纽特2113年11月23日\n\
地点: 火种公司, NO.010地下审讯室\n\
\n\
审讯员不紧不慢地从兜里掏出一盒烟, 抽出来一根点上: "请问, 你释放血肉团的动机是什么。"\n\
坐在审讯员对面的老者似乎被烟呛到了, 咳嗽了两声, 缓缓开口:\n\
"小时候, 我什么都想当。\n\
"我想当火种公司的首席议员, 我想当因纽特联邦主席, 我想成为第三集团军总指挥, 我想建设我美丽的母星, 查埃尔。\n\
"长大些的时候, 我想当一个战士, 一个工程师, 为社会创造价值。"\n\
审讯员开口打断道: "够了, 别再逼逼叨叨讲什么初中高中啥的拖延时间了...作为一个火种公司即将退休的老审讯员, 我负责任的告诉你, 没人会冒着被磁球切成两半的风险来救一个人类叛徒。"\n\
老者笑道: "既然如此, 你又何必催我? 无非急着下班罢了。"\n\
他继续着:\n\
"等去因纽特上了大学, 我发现我变了。\n\
"我想当一个自由自在的佣兵, 我想做一个飞船驾驶员, 我甚至考虑过去当一个吟游诗人, 走遍因纽特的名山大川。\n\
"但最终, 我也没能成为我想成为的人...我不过是一个普普通通的技工。"\n\
审讯员没忍住再次打断: "...技工怎么你了? 我以前也是个技工。..."\n\
老者并未理会:\n\
"我当了二十年的技工, 期间没修成过一天假... 我没日没夜的工作, 无数次心绞的时候, 我都怀疑自己要猝死了...然而我没有, 我怀着报复这个黑心公司的信念活了下来...\n\
"那一天, 我看见了被困在罐子里的它...\n\
"我看着它, 觉得我们俩真像啊... 一个被关在岗位上饱受压迫, 一个被困在瓶子里受尽折磨...\n\
"也不知是出于同情还是别的什么, 我打碎了那个罐子...\n\
"后来发生了什么, 也不消我再重复了。"\n\
审讯员: "你可曾考虑过这么干的后果? 你可知道什么叫非我族类其心必异?!"\n\
老者笑了, 笑声中掩盖着一层狂气:\n\
"你们**的对待底层员工比对待牲畜还不如, ...每次我申请休假被驳回时, 我都在想, 同样是被关在一个地方, 那些所谓的珍稀动物是成天吃了睡睡了吃, 但我们呢? 我们却要不停工作, 到了年份就被辞退, 从此流浪街头, 直到饿死冻死也无人问津, 你们口口声声所谓的[lightgray]人权[]呢? 在**哪里啊?!\n\
"什么非我族类其心必异, 也不过是你们自视堪高, 为压迫其他生物所提出的借口罢了。...\n\
"...你知道什么是狼狈为奸吗? 狼和狈其实是同一种动物, 而狈是失去行动能力的狼, ...就连被你们大肆屠杀的动物都有互帮互助的意识, 你们人类又为何自相残杀!"\n\
审讯员眯了眯眼: "所谓你们人类..."\n\
老者没有再说什么。\n\
审讯员拍了拍手: "好了, 看来你无法提供什么有价值的信息了..."\n\
就在此时, 老者突然抽搐起来。\n\
老者的四肢开始变粗变长, 整个人就如全身长满了疯狂增殖的肿瘤一般, 开始迅速膨胀, 转眼就填满了半间审讯室。\n\
审讯室墙上的防御系统适时激活, 几台「点燃」炮塔顷刻便将审讯室里的怪物烧成灰烬。\n\
\n\
/* ================ */\n\

后续赶来的一个实习人员在完成清扫任务, 回到休息的路上对同伴们啧啧称奇: "这鬼东西居然能侵蚀金属! 真是太神奇了, 刚刚我消毒的时候, 那块金属板子甚至想爬起来撞死我!"
